"""
    This module checks recorded VPs stored in the SPS table in the database
    with designed VPs. Repeated VPs are counted and a design_flag is set
    if a VP was in the original design. The output is a CSV file.
    arguments:
        Two arguments must be given to the program:
        - file name containing the design VPs and must have at least the
          following fields (separated by one or more spaces):
            column1, line, point, index
            (only line, point and index are used as columns 2, 3 and 4)
        - name of the sps table in the database
    output:
        - CSV file with recorded VPs with the following fields (separated
          by comma):
            line, point, easting, northing, elevation, count, design_flag
        - count is the number of times a VP has been repeated
        - design_flag is True if a VP was in the design, False if not
    pre-condition:
        - check is done on a block by block basis
        - recorded vps must be stored in the database in the sps table
